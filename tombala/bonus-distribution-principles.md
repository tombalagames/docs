Namely; the total number of different cards sold in the rooms,

In case of 30 and above; The cards that make 1st Zinc, 2nd Zinc and Tombala are eligible to win the jackpots of the respective room.

If it is between 20 and 30, only the 2nd Zinc and Tombala cards win, and if it is less than 20, only the Tombala cards win the jackpot.

Since Tombala is a pool game, if more than one player gets the same cards, the jackpot won is divided and distributed equally to the winners.
