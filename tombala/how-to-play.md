# How to play

Tombala has been designed on the traditional Turkish Tombala, taking into account the player habits, and is played decentralized with 90 Balls and 125 Fixed Cards. Players are given the opportunity to buy cards from the game rooms they want in the next and future draws and to participate in the draws in more than one room at the same time.
